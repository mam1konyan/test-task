As part of the application process, we would like you to complete a coding test to assess your proficiency in React, Redux, and TypeScript. Below are the tasks along with the corresponding API endpoints from JSONPlaceholder that you should use:

Fetching Data:

Use the GET /posts API endpoint to retrieve a list of posts from the JSONPlaceholder API.
Editing Data:

Use the GET /posts/{postId} API endpoint to fetch the data of a specific post for editing.

Use the PUT /posts/{postId} or PATCH /posts/{postId} API endpoint to update the post after editing.
Deleting Data:

Use the DELETE /posts/{postId} API endpoint to delete a specific post from the application and the API.
Updating Data:

Use the POST /posts API endpoint to create a new post.
Use the PUT /posts/{postId} or PATCH /posts/{postId} API endpoint to update a post.

Please ensure that you implement Redux for state management, TypeScript for type safety, and connect the components to the Redux store. Additionally, handle asynchronous actions such as API calls using Redux Thunk or a middleware of your choice.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need further clarification. We look forward to reviewing your code.
